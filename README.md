# MetronomeTest
Trying to figure out how to synchronize AudioTrack playback with UI.  
The metronome was originally based on the [BeatKeeper](https://github.com/MasterEx/BeatKeeper) app/repo. I've made several changes and tried to make this as simple as possible (which is why I didn't fork the original repo). The BeatKeeper repo attempts better audio/visual synchronization, but I find it doesn't work very well.
